# Frontend developer assignment

## Improvements

Given how time constrained I was on this assignment, there are many obvious improvement I would have liked to make, such as:

1. Improve general styling and design
1. Add Y and X axis lines and labels
1. Fix bug where rescaling the chart sometimes causes wrong item to highlight on hover
1. Implement in canvas to improve performance by a lot
1. Would like to clean up CandleStickChart and split it up
1. Add tests for key chart logic
1. Not put API key in source code, especially not in source code being sent to client
1. Improve accessibility by proving an option to view data as a table
